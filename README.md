Line Follower Robot
This project involves designing and implementing a Line Follower Robot. The robot is designed to follow a predefined path using sensors to detect and navigate the line. The robot starts following the line as soon as it receives a START message.

Introduction
The Line Follower Robot is an autonomous robot capable of following a line drawn on the floor. This project is ideal for understanding basic robotics, sensor integration, and control systems.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: The robot uses sensors to follow a line without human intervention.
START Command: The robot begins operation upon receiving a START message.
Real-time Adjustment: The robot can adjust its path in real-time based on sensor input.
Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
Line sensors (e.g., IR sensors)
Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
DC motors
Chassis for the robot
Wheels
Battery pack
Bluetooth or WiFi module (for receiving the START message)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or other suitable development environment
Python (if using Raspberry Pi)
Libraries:
Motor driver library
Sensor reading library
Communication protocol library (e.g., pySerial for Python)
Installation
Hardware Setup
Assemble the robot chassis.
Attach the motors to the chassis and connect them to the motor driver.
Attach the line sensors to the front of the robot.
Connect the motor driver and sensors to the microcontroller.
Connect the Bluetooth/WiFi module to the microcontroller.
Software Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/line-follower-robot.git
cd line-follower-robot
Open the project in your development environment.

Upload the provided code to your microcontroller.

Usage
Power on the robot.
Send the START message via the communication module.
The robot will start following the line.
Code Overview
Main Code
The main code is responsible for:

Initializing the sensors and motor driver
Continuously reading sensor data
Adjusting motor speeds based on sensor input to follow the line
Handling the START message to initiate line following
Example Code Snippet
cpp
Copy code
#include <MotorDriver.h>
#include <LineSensor.h>
#include <CommunicationModule.h>

void setup() {
    // Initialize components
    MotorDriver.init();
    LineSensor.init();
    CommunicationModule.init();
}

void loop() {
    // Check for START message
    if (CommunicationModule.receivedStartMessage()) {
        while (true) {
            // Read sensor values
            int sensorValue = LineSensor.read();
            
            // Adjust motor speeds
            MotorDriver.adjustMotors(sensorValue);
        }
    }
}
